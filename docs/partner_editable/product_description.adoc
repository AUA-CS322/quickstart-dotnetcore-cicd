The {partner-product-name} environment manages application updates using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy. Whenever code is modified within a configured GitHub repository branch, the CI/CD pipeline fetches the latest source code and automatically builds the application. It then deploys the application to the target environment: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which now https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/aws-elastic-beanstalk-announces-net-core-on-linux-platform/[supports .NET Core on the Linux platform^].

This scalable deployment helps you deliver features and updates rapidly and reliably. You have no build servers to manage, and you pay only for what you use.
