This Quick Start provides a complete automated CI/CD environment. It benefits organizations that want to automate their .NET Core application release pipelines. It provides fully managed application updates using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy. 

Whenever code is modified within a configured GitHub repository branch, the CI/CD pipeline builds the code automatically. It then deploys the .NET Core application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Beanstalk now https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/aws-elastic-beanstalk-announces-net-core-on-linux-platform/[supports .NET Core on the Linux platform^].

The CI/CD environment does the following:

* Fetches the latest source code and save it to a source artifact store.
* Automatically builds the application.
* Deploys the application to the target environment.
